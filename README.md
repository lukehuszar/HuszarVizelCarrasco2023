 Data &amp; code for plots and analysis from content discussed in manuscript 

Use 'main.m' to reproduce figures and model comparison from manuscript. All original code is heavily commented, including functions used throughout, to help readers follow along with the contents of the manuscript. Depends on the  [VBA Toolbox](https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/wiki/BMS-for-group-studies/) and [cbrewer2](https://github.com/scottclowe/cbrewer2) - both of which are included in '3rd party toolboxes'.

'PSE ANOVA.R' is for the frequentist statistics reported in the manuscript. 

The stimulus images (pixel value matrices) have been removed from the raw data files because of space limitations here, but I'm happy to send them to anyone interested.
